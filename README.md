Investigation of faces from fine art collections.

In this project, I'm working on generating faces as they appear in art pieces to compare the performance between
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs).

I am hoping to build an latent space embedding that captures the wide array of art styles found in my dataset.


Models I am using:

1. Plain VAE   (DONE)
2. Deep Feature Consisten VAE with Perceptual Loss (In Training)
3. Plain GAN (In Training)
4. StyleGAN (???)
